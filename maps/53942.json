{"info": {"gameMode": "normal", "name": "Submit your custom maps for consideration for inclusion in the official rotation selection. Learn more at the [wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/maps) If you are still unsure how to proceed, ask at /r/TagProTesting, the [Mapmaking Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/YbyyXgS), or contact an MTC member.  ___  **Deadline**: October 29th at 3pm PST. ___  **Basic Guidelines**  * Mapmakers are limited to 3 maps per thread.  * Use the format outlined below. * Maps and preview images must be hosted on unfortunate-maps.  ___  **Submission Format**  *Entries must be submitted in this format to be considered for rotation.*  Reply to this post with your title, map type (CTF or Neutral Flag), a link to the map page, a preview image, and an (optional) description.   You can copy and paste this:      **Title:**      **Type:**       **Map:**      **Preview:**      **Description:**  If done correctly, your submission should end up looking [something like this](https://i.groupme.com/960x960.jpeg.a78b98b4daab4ea0b379d812aea0b988) (but hopefully not exactly like it).  ---  **This Thread's Mapmaking Tip**    Struggling to make your map better? Fiddle around with the symmetry. Even if the map works, changing the flow of the map can help piece it together.  ___  If you have the opportunity to participate in a 4v4 maptest on your map, be sure to do that before submitting. If not, the next best thing are the weekly map threads over at /r/TagProTesting.   We strongly encourage everybody to take a look at submissions and to reply with constructive feedback.
