See I invented Map Pun, it wasn't any Map Puns. And now I look and look around and there's so many Map Puns. I used to love Map Pun, I used to love Map Pun. I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Map Pun. What if Map Pun made a map, about Map Pun? Called \"I Miss The Old Map Pun,\" man that would be so Map Pun. That's all it was Map Pun, we still love Map Pun.
