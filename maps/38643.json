{"info": {"gameMode": "normal", "name": "Due to recent events surrounding the cheating of various Major League TagPro players, I feel like I need to get this off my chest. I'm doing it anonymously because I'm afraid of the hate I will get and yes, that's cowardly. I admit it. I probably will let the cat out of the bag to the few people I trust not to make me hate myself for what I did, but the general public probably shouldn't know. Anyways, here I go. I was a TagPro captain, at some point before the current season. I was considered to be among the best defenders at the time, and I felt very proud of my accomplishments and status in the community. Being good at something and having others look up to you is a phenomenal sensation. It wasn't skill that got me there however. It was at first, but then that all changed when I experimented with botting. I was probably one of the first to successfully use automated scripts to get ahead of my opponents. Powerup timers, movement detection, juke enchancers, I spent hours making programs that turned me into the player I was known for. I equated it to taking steroids in professional sports. Plenty of other people are doing it too, at least I fooled myself into thinking that, and it appeased my consciousness somewhat. Now players like Greifseeds and Checknate, players who were fairly well known in competitive play, are getting banned for life and I managed to get accolades doing the same things. It's wrong, and I know it now, and I want everyone to know it too. As tempting as it is, and believe me it's tempting, don't fucking do it. You're screwing with hundreds of innocent people who have enough dignity to play fair.", "author": "Ball-E"}, "portals": {}, "fields": {}, "switches": {}, "marsballs": [], "spawnPoints": {"blue": [], "red": []}}
