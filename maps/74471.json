{"info": {"gameMode": "normal", "name": "So, the thing is, i've always liked anime, and of course i also liked hentai, so sometimes i'd jerk off to that instead of normal porn. However, i didn't realize that for the past 5 years or so i've masturbated exclusively to hentai. No normal porn at all. I also did it quite frequently, about 4 to 5 times a day. Early today a friend of mine shared me some feet pics of an e-girl he'd been chatting with, and my penis stayed soft. I started to fear that i'd become erectyle dysfunctional, so i went to pornhub and tried to jerk off, but my penis stayed soft no matter what kind of porn i looked at. Even milfs had no effect on my flaccid phallus. But then a hentai video popped up in my suggestions, and just from looking at the thumbnail my dick became rock hard. It was that moment that i realized that i would only get erections from anime girls. I'm very worried that in the future i might never be able to have sex with a normal woman and also never lose my virginity. What do i do now?", "author": "denki"}, "portals": {"22,12": {"cooldown": 0, "destination": {"y": 8, "x": 22}}, "22,20": {"cooldown": 0, "destination": {"y": 24, "x": 22}}, "22,8": {"cooldown": 0, "destination": {"y": 12, "x": 22}}, "22,24": {"cooldown": 0, "destination": {"y": 20, "x": 22}}}, "fields": {"7,12": {"defaultState": "off"}, "7,10": {"defaultState": "off"}, "7,11": {"defaultState": "off"}, "37,21": {"defaultState": "off"}, "37,20": {"defaultState": "off"}, "37,22": {"defaultState": "off"}}, "switches": {"37,16": {"toggle": [{"pos": {"y": 22, "x": 37}}, {"pos": {"y": 21, "x": 37}}, {"pos": {"y": 20, "x": 37}}], "timer": 0}, "7,16": {"toggle": [{"pos": {"y": 10, "x": 7}}, {"pos": {"y": 11, "x": 7}}, {"pos": {"y": 12, "x": 7}}], "timer": 0}}, "marsballs": [], "spawnPoints": {"blue": [{"y": 21, "x": 32, "radius": 5, "weight": 1}], "red": [{"y": 11, "x": 12, "radius": 5, "weight": 1}]}}
